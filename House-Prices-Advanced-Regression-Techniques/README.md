**翻译的朋友们请先[【Fork】](https://github.com/OpenSourceAI/kaggle-competition-details/fork)本库，在自己的库中当前文件夹下面，以原文件名加【-中文】的方式命名【新建文件】（例如：原本文件名：introduction-to-cnn-keras-0-997-top-6.ipynb，新建文件名即：introduction-to-cnn-keras-0-997-top-6-中文.ipynb），完成翻译整理后进行`Pull Request`，经过其他朋友代码审查，会合并到本库，同时你们的贡献也会被记录在此页面。**

>**在翻译整理的过程中请尽量深入理解文章，并提出自己的理解，不要只是为了翻译而翻译**

>**如果会其他语言的同学也欢迎翻译成其他语言，例如：俄语、韩语、日语等等**

## 介绍

Start here if...
You have some experience with R or Python and machine learning basics. This is a perfect competition for data science students who have completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to expand their skill set before trying a featured competition. 

Competition Description


Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering 
Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
